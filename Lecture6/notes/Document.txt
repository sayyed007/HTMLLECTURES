Hello, future web designers! Today, we're diving into the creative world of text formatting in HTML. It's like adding special effects to your words, making them stand out and look super cool on your webpage. Ready to become text styling experts? Let's go!

1. Adding Strength with <strong>:

Imagine you want to shout out a word in your sentence. The <strong> tag is like putting that word in bold caps. It makes your text stronger and bolder!

<p>This is a <strong>strong</strong> message!</p>
It will look like:
This is a strong message!

2. Making Text Smaller with <small>:

Sometimes you want to whisper instead of shouting. The <small> tag makes your text a little smaller, like a secret note or a fine print.

<p>This is some <small>small text</small> here.</p>
It will look like:
This is some <small>small text</small> here.

3. Highlighting with <mark>:

Want to highlight something important? The <mark> tag is like using a highlighter. It adds a splash of color to your text.
<p>Pay attention to this <mark>highlighted</mark> word!</p>
It will look like:
Pay attention to this <mark>highlighted</mark> word!

4. Going Bold and Italic with <b> and <i>:

The <b> tag makes your text bold, and the <i> tag makes it italic. It's like giving your words a little dance move â€“ either a bold stomp or a graceful tilt.

<p>This is <b>bold</b> and this is <i>italic</i>.</p>
It will look like:
This is bold and this is italic.

5. Emphasizing with <em>:

The <em> tag is like saying, "Hey, this word is extra important!" It adds emphasis, making your text more noticeable.
<p>This is <em>emphasized</em> text.</p>
It will look like:
This is emphasized text.

6. Super and Sub with <sup> and <sub>:

Want to make your text go up or down? <sup> makes it superscript (like a tiny superhero flying above), and <sub> makes it subscript (like a tiny explorer going below).
<p>2<sup>3</sup> means 2 cubed, and H<sub>2</sub>O is water!</p>
It will look like:
2<sup>3</sup> means 2 cubed, and H<sub>2</sub>O is water!

7. Adding a Strikethrough and Underline with <del> and <ins>:

The <del> tag adds a strikethrough, like crossing something off your list. And <ins> adds an underline, making your text stand out even more.

<p><del>Don't do this</del> and <ins>try this instead</ins>.</p>
It will look like:
<del>Don't do this</del> and <ins>try this instead</ins>.
