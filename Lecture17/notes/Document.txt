1. What are Block and Inline Elements?

In HTML, elements are like the ingredients we use to cook up our webpages. Block and inline elements are two main categories that describe how these elements behave in terms of layout. Let's break it down:

Block Elements: These are like the big building blocks. They start on a new line and stretch out to the full width of their container. They create a new "block" or section of content. For example, <div>, <p>, <h1>.

Inline Elements: These are like the smaller details. They don't start on a new line, and they only take up as much width as necessary. They flow within the content. For example, <span>, <a>, <strong>.

2. Block Elements in Action:

Let's take a look at some block elements in action. It's like creating sections or building blocks in our webpage:
<!-- Block elements -->
<div>This is a block element.</div>
<p>This is another block element, creating a new paragraph.</p>
<h1>This is a heading, a big block of text.</h1>
Here, each element starts on a new line and takes up the full width of its container. It's like stacking LEGO blocks on top of each other to create a structure.

3. Inline Elements in Action:

Now, let's explore some inline elements. It's like adding small details within the content of our webpage:
<!-- Inline elements -->
<p>This is a <span style="color: red;">red</span> word.</p>
<a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link to Example.com</a>
<strong>This text is bold and inline.</strong>
Here, the inline elements flow within the content. It's like adding LEGO pieces between the bigger blocks to create intricate patterns.
