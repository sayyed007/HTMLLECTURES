Hello, fantastic future web creators! Today, we're adding a bit of magic to our webpages by learning how to change the colors of our links in different states. It's like giving our links a whole wardrobe of colors for different occasions. Let's dive into the colorful world of HTML links!

1. The Magic Trio:

Links in HTML can have different colors for three special occasions: when they are just sitting there (normal), when someone hovers over them (hover), and when someone clicks on them (active). Let's call this trio the "magic trio" of link colors!

2. The <style> Tag:

To make our links change colors, we'll use the <style> tag, which is like a magical paintbrush for our webpage.

3. Styling Links with CSS:

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, helps us style our webpage, and we'll use it to create the magic trio. Here's a simple example:

<style>
    /* Normal link color */
    a {
        color: blue;
    }

    /* Link color when hovered over */
    a:hover {
        color: red;
    }

    /* Link color when clicked (active) */
    a:active {
        color: green;
    }

    /* Visited link color */
    a:visited {
        color: purple;
    }
</style>
In this example, a represents all the links on your webpage. color: blue; sets the normal link color, :hover is like a magic spell for when someone hovers over the link, :active is for when the link is clicked, and :visited is for links that have already been clicked.

4. Choosing Your Own Colors:

Now, you can pick your own colors for each state. It's like choosing outfits for your links! Here's an example:
<style>
    /* Normal link color */
    a {
        color: #336699; /* Light blue */
    }

    /* Link color when hovered over */
    a:hover {
        color: #ff6666; /* Light red */
    }

    /* Link color when clicked (active) */
    a:active {
        color: #339933; /* Light green */
    }

    /* Visited link color */
    a:visited {
        color: #9966cc; /* Light purple */
    }
</style>
Feel free to change the colors to your favorites!

5. Putting It All Together:

Let's put everything we've learned into a simple HTML file:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Colorful Links Example</title>

    <style>
        /* Normal link color */
        a {
            color: #336699; /* Light blue */
        }

        /* Link color when hovered over */
        a:hover {
            color: #ff6666; /* Light red */
        }

        /* Link color when clicked (active) */
        a:active {
            color: #339933; /* Light green */
        }

        /* Visited link color */
        a:visited {
            color: #9966cc; /* Light purple */
        }
    </style>
</head>

In this example, the link starts as a light blue and turns light red when someone hovers over it, light green when clicked, and light purple once visited. It's like having a fashion show for your links!
